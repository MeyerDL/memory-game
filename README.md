# Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game
This is a memory game to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons. Match the icons in less time and less moves.
If you make more than 10 moves one star will be removed, and more that 20 moves another star will be removed. Play the game over and over again to beat your moves and time. 

## How the game works: 
-You need to match the cards in less time with less moves.<br>
-There are eight pairs of cards on the game board<br>
-Click on one of the cards and it will show an icon<br><br>
-Click on another card to find the matching icon<br>
-If it matches it will turn the same colour green<br>
-If the cards doesn't match it will be flipped on their back again<br>
-Every card you flip will be a move<br>
-After you matched all pairs a stats window will open to display your results<br>
-You can then either cancel or replay the game<br>
